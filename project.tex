\section{Introduction\label{sec:introduction}}
This is my introduction

Concurrency in modern software systems needs abstractions
that simplify reasoning and fully exploit distributed
architectures as discussed in \cite{10.1145/357980.358021}.
The Actor Model provides an abstraction by encapsulating state
with independent actors that communicate only through
asynchronous messaging. Each actor processes one message
at a time from its mailbox, preventing data races and deadlocks.
Strict encapsulation ensures that only the actor itself can read
or update its internal state, thus not  needing locks.
By decoupling senders and receivers, asynchronous messaging
removes head-of-line blocking and allows flexible scheduling.
Optimized mailbox implementationsâ€”ranging from lock-free,
unbounded queues in Scalaz to bounded,
configurable mailboxes in Akka tune enqueue and dequeue
performance under varying workloads. Work-stealing dispatchers,
such as those provided by Grand Central Dispatch or the fork-join pool,
adapt automatically and balance load without manual thread management.
This survey examines how mailbox structures, dispatcher strategies,
and actor hierarchies interact to optimize scalability, fault tolerance,
and programmability in actor-based systems.
